<!-- <h2> This repository is my Linux operating system configuration (arch + bspwm). </h2>

<h3> Foreword and excuses: </h3>
<h4> Why Linux? </h4>
I was prompted to move into the world of Linux by a very large waste of the resource of my laptop operating system windows. <br> <br>
However, I haven't completely switched to Linux. I am using dualboot with write to nvram chip (not recommended for inexperienced users). The second system is still windows for unsupported programs by the Linux system (analogs of windows applications for Linux do not meet the needs, and the use of virtualbox technology is not rational, focusing on performance). <br> <br>
It is likely that I will write a guide to fully install my dualboot configuration.

<h4> Why Arch? </h4>
I decided to use arch because of its popularity and some features that can be devoted to a whole article)

<h4> Why DE (bspwm)? </h4>
I decided to use DE because of the possibility of assembling the system in a puzzle format. That allows you to suppress unnecessary load on the system and give performance gains where necessary. <br> <br>
Bspwm was chosen because it is the most popular DE for arch.

<h4> Why are there unnecessary folders, after all, everything can work without them? </h4>
Many people find it very unreasonable to add unnecessary folders to standard paths and I agree with them. The fact is that I look to the future, add "extra" folders at once, for the planned updates. In addition, these folders complete the hierarchy for a laconic user experience.

<h4> Why am I using fork picom and not the official package? </h4>
Because I was never able to achieve rounded corners using the official package, fork supports this out of the box.
